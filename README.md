# About Me
Hi. I hope you're having a nice day! I'm not going to provide my name as I feel like I would be giving an unsafe amount of personal information to the public. I live in the United Kingdom and I am... well you can say very young. I am not even a teenager yet. I faked my age to get on this platform so I am probably violating the TOS of Github - I think. I hope my account doesn't get terminated.

I am very passionate about coding. I started when I was 8 on Scratch (the free platform where you make games with blocks). When I was 9 or almost 9, I wanted to make Roblox games. So, I learnt (I'm not sure if in the UK it's learned or learnt...) Luau - the language used for developing Roblox 'experiences' as they call it now. As I grew slightly older, I would learn more about some other languages - I mean only JavaScript (lol). Then, I purchased a Python course and started learning Python. I have almost finished this super long course by Code With Mosh! He's super easy to understand! If I don't understand him I just rewatch the video in a slower speed a few times and then I understand it!

# Libraries Used

# Install
1. Download main.py and Python if you haven't already got it @ https://python.org or on Windows perhaps Microsoft Store

3. Execute the following if on Linux or Mac: 'python3 main.py' and on other Operating Systems: 'python main.py'

This is a super small project - it only took a few lines of code to create the file and it's open source!
